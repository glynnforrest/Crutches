Included classes:

* DotArray - Set and get values from complex array structures easily.
* ItemList - Manipulate a list of objects (arrays with numeric
  keys). Methods are inspired by functional concepts such as map,
  filter and take. All methods that operate on the list return a new
  instance, leaving the original list unchanged.
* MutableItemList - The same as ItemList, except all methods modify
  the object instead of returning a new instance.
* Bitmask - A series of flags used to represent a group of properties
  (e.g. user permissions).
* NamedBitmask - An extension of Bitmask that abstracts numeric flags
  away from the user, instead referring to named flags.
* Roman - Convert integers to roman numerals and back again.

See the docs/ directory for detailed usage on each.
